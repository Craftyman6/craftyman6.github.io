# Kit Study Website
*This site can be accessed via the [Home Page](https://craftyman6.github.io/Kit%20Study/home.html)*
## What is this?
This is a website for studying the kits of Splatoon 3's main weapons. It's difficult for players to remember the sub and special weapons assigned to all 143 weapons in the game, so this site provides quizzes and resources to building memory towards them.
